## easy arduino projects I use for me and my students 

in the folder Suiza (Switzerland) you can find a couple of easy projects I taugh some teens this summer, as they were learning C and Arduino for the first time. They are:

##agua
Agua (water) is a simple program used to show how the water sensor works.

##muñeco
Muñeco (doll) is another super simple program which is used toshow a basic movement with the servo. Is called doll because in class I attached a cute cardboard doll so the project would look better.

Outside the folder Suiza, you can find HAL9000 and juego aleatorio. They both use the same hardware:

##HAL9000
It's a program that works with a LCD creen, and a button, that shows random HAL9000 sentences. 

##juego aleatorio 
Or, random game, is a roleplaying game that plays randomly on its own and count the stepts you reached until dying. It starts with a character that has 5 lives. He can Walks, Enter in a house, Stumbles, Take 4 objects, and Use them if he took them. He can die both stumbling 5 times or shootinghimself with a gun. Good look! I got 30 points.
